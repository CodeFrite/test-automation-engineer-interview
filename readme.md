# Interview BNPPF : Test Automation Engineer Position - Exercise

Today is a great day as I am going to code a solution for an exercise proposed by BNPPF Testing Team Lead,for a Test Automation Engineer position. It is currently 25 Jan 2025 9AM and I have 3 days to complete the exercise. I am excited to start coding and learning a few new things along the way. So let's get started!

## Exercise

The goal of the exercise is to create a Test Automation Framework to automate the testing of the APIs used on a hotel booking website located here: https://automationintesting.online/

There are two endpoints which are documented using OpenAPI specification (Swagger):

- `Booking:` https://automationintesting.online/booking/swagger-ui/index.html
- `Message:` https://automationintesting.online/message/swagger-ui/index.html

## Requirements

I am required to use the following tools:

- `Java` as the programming language
- `RestAssured` for API testing
- `Cucumber` for the BDD approach
- `Github` for the version control and to document the progress
- `Design Patterns` to structure the code in a maintainable way
- `Test Coverage` is left at my discretion but should be wide enough to demonstrate different testing techniques and types of tests
